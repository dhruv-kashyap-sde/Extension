# Font Changer Chrome Extension

## Overview

The Font Changer Chrome Extension is a tool designed for web developers and designers to quickly test different fonts on their webpages. By selecting a font from a dropdown list, users can instantly apply the chosen font to all text elements on the page, making it easier to decide on the best typography without the need for extensive CSS modifications.

## Problem Statement

During the development of a web project, designers often reach a stage where the layout and structure are ready, but the visual aesthetics, such as fonts, need to be fine-tuned. Traditionally, this involves integrating various fonts through Google Fonts or downloading them from the internet to test their appearance. This process can be time-consuming and inefficient, often requiring multiple iterations to find the perfect match.

The Font Changer Chrome Extension addresses this challenge by providing an easy-to-use interface that allows developers to quickly switch between different fonts. This significantly reduces the time spent on typography decisions and streamlines the design process.
